# hero-clash

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Installation

The landing page will have a character creation sheet for the player. A image will be generated based off of their players race and class and that image will be taken on an adventure.
The fates control what is in store.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

https://github.com/Amartind - collaborator

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

https://open5e.com/ - API
http://www.dnd5eapi.co/docs/#overview - API
https://2minutetabletop.com/product-category/free/ - Hero Tokens and Monster Tokens


If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).
